# SMU-Project-3-US_Executions
The Execution Xplore project aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for exploring and understanding historical data on executions in the United States. The project encompasses interactive visualizations and an interactive map, all made accessible through a dynamic website.

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Data Collection and Preparation: The project begins with collecting reliable and accurate data on executions in the United States from various trustworthy sources. The data is then processed and cleaned to ensure consistency and usability.

Interactive Visualizations: Using modern web technologies like D3.js, Plotly, or other suitable libraries, the project creates interactive visualizations that allow users to explore patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset. The visualizations may include bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and more.

Interactive Map: Leveraging interactive mapping libraries like Leaflet or Mapbox, the project implements an interactive map that displays the geographical distribution of executions across the United States. Users can explore executions based on location and other relevant attributes.

Web Application Development: The heart of the project is a user-friendly website where the interactive visualizations and map come together seamlessly. The website is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
